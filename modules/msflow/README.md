# Node: startFlow

This node executes a Microsoft Flow. It requires the following parameters:

- Flow URL (generated by following these steps: https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/call-flow-restapi/)
- Payload (JSON payload to send to the Microsoft Flow)
- Callback API URL (if the Flow is supposed to call Cognigy.AI back, provide the callback URL here)

### Calling Cognigy.AI back from Micrsoft Flow
Microsoft Flow can call Cognigy.AI back and inject a message into an existing session (see https://docs.cognigy.com/reference). This can for example be useful to notify the user of a step in Microsoft Flow finishing.

In order to call Cognigy.AI back, we need various parameters:

- userId*
- sessionId*
- endpoint url token*
- callback url*
- text
- data

If the Callback API URL parameter of the Node is not empty, this module will automatically append all parameters marked with * to the Payload which is being sent to Microsoft Flow. Flow can then use a HTTP request to call Cognigy.AI back with the required text and data.
